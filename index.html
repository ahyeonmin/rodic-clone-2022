                    Rodić Davidson: London Architecture
                </h2>
                <div class="discription__text">
                    <p>
                        Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London since 2006.
                        Having worked within the oldest areas of London,
                        we have developed an expertise in historic buildings.
                        These are often Listed and situated within a Conservation Area.
                        Our knowledge and experience consistently secure Planning Consents,
                        Listed Building Consents and Great Estate Licenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many areas within central London boroughs were originally
                        developed by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor,
                        Cadogan, De Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still
                        own large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central London.
                        These Great Estates maintain significant influence either through direct ownership
                        or through various stewardship schemes, an example being the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme
                        administered by Grosvenor. Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control over the use,
                        development, and appearance of the designated area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and elsewhere the UK.
                        Through sensitive, contextual design and iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners,
                        Rodić Davidson have established a track record of obtaining difficult planning consents
                        for both new-build and existing properties.

                        We are Rodić Davidson, an award-winning architecture, design, and
                        interiors studio with the belief that buildings are more than brick and mortar;
                        they are an extension of ourselves and our environment.
                        Our practice specializes in design-led and highly crafted renovations and new-builds.
                        We pride ourselves on an ability to deliver thoughtful and imaginative design whilst safeguarding our clients’ commercial interests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are and RIBA Chartered Practice based in Bloomsbury, central London.
                        Whilst much of our work is local to us in London, the practice has an expanding
                        portfolio of work across the UK; predominantly in the east and southeast of England
                        but also including projects reaching as far as Scotland. We have experience working
                        in rural locations, particularly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and Sussex where we have
                        undertaken a number of farmstead and country house projects, for both UK and
                        overseas-based clients. These projects often involve sensitive restoration of
                        listed buildings, usually with some more contemporary new-build additions.
                        The practice seeks to develop sensitive yet ambitious design solutions that celebrate
                        heritage while recognizing that buildings are often now required to perform different
                        functions and should consume less carbon in doing so. In striving for lower carbon
                        design solutions, we look to insulate well and integrate renewable technologies wherever possible.

                        Much of our work, specifically that in Prime Central London,
                        involves the refurbishment, alteration and extension of houses and
                        historic buildings that are often Listed. This is often referred to
                        as Conservation Architecture. Rodić Davidson have experience at working
                        with all grades of Listed Building: whether these be Grade 2, Grade 2* or Grade 1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our design response sometimes looks to introduce modern insertions into historic buildings,
                        thereby providing visual separation between elements and allowing the historic fabric to be
                        repaired using traditional methods and materials. This approach can result in clearly articulated
                        functional spaces, allowing appreciation of the traditionally proportioned rooms and spaces
                        but also combining new, larger spaces with clean crisp lines.
